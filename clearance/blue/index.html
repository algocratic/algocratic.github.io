    <div class="executive-suite">
        <strong class="gold">CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR TRANSCENDENCE</strong><br><br>
        You have successfully failed upward into the BLUE clearance stratum, where accountability is inversely 
        proportional to compensation. Your primary workspace is now any location that isn't here, and your 
        calendar exists in a quantum state of "busy" and "unreachable."<br><br>
        
        <em>Welcome to Easy Street. Population: You.</em>
    </div>

            <li>Vanish before clarifying questions can be asked</li>
            <li>Return three sprints later wondering why your vision wasn't implemented</li>
            <li>Express disappointment in "lack of initiative" when teams follow your exact instructions</li>

    <h2>RESOURCE ALLOCATION POWERS</h2>
    
    <div class="privilege">
        You now control:
        <ul>
            <li>Budget that exists in theory but not in practice</li>
            <li>Headcount that's always "under review"</li>
            <li>Timeline that ignores basic mathematics</li>
            <li>Scope that expands according to your mood</li>
            <li>Quality standards that change post-delivery</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>MEETING DOMINANCE PROTOCOLS</h2>
    
    <div class="executive-suite">
        <strong>EXECUTIVE PRESENCE MAXIMIZATION</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Join 15 minutes late (establishes importance)</li>
            <li>Ask for recap of everything discussed (wastes 10 more minutes)</li>
            <li>Contradict the meeting's premise (ensures confusion)</li>
            <li>Introduce unrelated priority (derails productivity)</li>
            <li>Leave early for "another commitment" (maintains mystery)</li>
            <li>Follow up with conflicting email (guarantees chaos)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>PERFORMANCE METRICS (YOURS)</h2>
    
    <div class="privilege">
        <strong>SUCCESS INDICATORS</strong><br>
        The Algorithm measures your excellence through:
        <ul>
            <li>Number of buzzwords per email (minimum: 7)</li>
            <li>Meetings avoided while appearing busy (target: 80%)</li>
            <li>Strategic pivots announced per quarter (optimal: 3-5)</li>
            <li>Direct reports confused (should approach 100%)</li>
            <li>Times you've said "synergy" unironically (no maximum)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>YOUR ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    
    <div class="executive-suite" style="border-color: red;">
        <strong style="color: #ffaaaa;">⚠️ CLASSIFIED - BLUE EYES ONLY ⚠️</strong><br><br>
        Between us BLUE clearance holders, here's what you actually do:
        <ul>
            <li>Attend other BLUE clearance holders' meetings about meetings</li>
            <li>Compete for INDIGO attention through increasingly abstract strategies</li>
            <li>Generate work to justify your existence</li>
            <li>Perfect the art of looking essential while being optional</li>
            <li>Maintain plausible deniability for all decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <em>Remember: The secret to BLUE clearance is ensuring no one understands what you do,
