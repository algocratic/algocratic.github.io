    <h1>GREEN CLEARANCE: SPRINT ORCHESTRATION DIRECTOR</h1>
    <p class="algorithmic-truth">Strategic Initiative Management Division</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR STRATEGIC ELEVATION</strong><br>
        As a GREEN-clearance Sprint Orchestration Director, you have transcended mere code production. 
        You now bear the burden of translating The Algorithm's infinite wisdom into achievable sprint goals 
        that somehow satisfy both technical reality and executive fantasy.
    </div>

    <h2>YOUR SACRED RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    
    <div class="requirement">
        <strong>SPRINT PLANNING FACILITATION</strong><br>
        You must conduct Sprint Planning ceremonies that:
        <ul>
            <li>Transform vague executive visions into specific user stories</li>
            <li>Estimate story points using Planning Poker™ (actual poker faces recommended)</li>
            <li>Maintain the illusion that 40 story points equals 40 hours</li>
            <li>Negotiate sprint goals that are simultaneously ambitious and achievable</li>
            <li>Document acceptance criteria that everyone will ignore until the demo</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="requirement">
        <strong>BACKLOG REFINEMENT MASTERY</strong><br>
        Your Product Backlog must be:
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritized according to The Algorithm's mysterious business value calculations</li>
            <li>Groomed regularly (but never completely, to ensure job security)</li>
            <li>Written in user story format: "As a [sufficiently vague stakeholder], I want [something impossible], so that [profit increases]"</li>
            <li>Estimated in story points that definitely aren't just hours in disguise</li>
            <li>Updated continuously as requirements "evolve" (translation: change completely)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="requirement">
        <strong>DAILY STANDUP ORCHESTRATION</strong><br>
        You will facilitate daily ceremonies where team members must:
        <ul>
            <li>Report yesterday's achievements (minimum 3 buzzwords required)</li>
            <li>Commit to today's impossible tasks with visible enthusiasm</li>
            <li>Identify blockers without implying management is the blocker</li>
            <li>Complete all updates in exactly 15 minutes (use timer for psychological pressure)</li>
            <li>Stand physically to ensure discomfort accelerates communication</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>SPRINT DELIVERY CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>⚠️ CERTIFICATION MANDATE ⚠️</strong><br>
        To achieve GREEN clearance certification, you must successfully deliver ONE (1) complete sprint containing:
        <ul>
            <li>✓ Functional software that actually runs (crashes are "features in development")</li>
            <li>✓ At least 5 completed user stories (definition of "complete" subject to interpretation)</li>
            <li>✓ Sprint burndown chart showing "healthy" progress (manipulation encouraged)</li>
            <li>✓ Retrospective documentation proving continuous improvement occurred</li>
            <li>✓ Demo to stakeholders where nothing breaks catastrophically</li>
        </ul>
        Failure to deliver will result in "coaching opportunities" and potential clearance re-evaluation.
    </div>

    <h2>SCRUM ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT</h2>
    
    <div class="requirement">
        <strong>VELOCITY TRACKING</strong><br>
        You must maintain team velocity metrics that:
        <ul>
            <li>Show consistent improvement (reality adjustment permitted)</li>
            <li>Justify why 30 story points this sprint differs from 30 points last sprint</li>
            <li>Predict future capacity with false precision</li>
            <li>Never reveal that estimates are completely arbitrary</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="requirement">
        <strong>BURNDOWN CHART INTERPRETATION</strong><br>
        Your burndown charts must tell a story of:
        <ul>
            <li>Initial optimism (steep early decline)</li>
            <li>Mid-sprint panic (plateau of despair)</li>
            <li>Last-minute heroics (vertical drop before demo)</li>
            <li>Success despite impossible odds (reaching zero somehow)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Agree with their vision while implementing something achievable</li>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> Pretend their process improvements help</li>
        <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Shield them from requirement changes until absolutely necessary</li>
        <li><strong>Upper Management:</strong> Report progress in percentages that total more than 100%</li>
        <li><strong>The Algorithm:</strong> Consult for all critical decisions, ignore when convenient</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE FACILITATION</h2>
    
    <div class="requirement">
        You must conduct retrospectives that:
        <ul>
            <li>Identify what went well (mandatory minimum: 3 items)</li>
            <li>Discuss what could improve (without assigning blame)</li>
            <li>Generate action items (that won't be actioned)</li>
            <li>Create the illusion of psychological safety</li>
            <li>Document lessons learned (in write-only storage)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>ADVANCED STRATEGIC TECHNIQUES</h2>
    
    <div class="algorithmic-truth">
        As a GREEN-clearance director, you have discovered these truths:
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Definition of Done is negotiable until sprint review</li>
        <li>Technical debt is just "deferred innovation"</li>
        <li>Scope creep is "agile flexibility in action"</li>
        <li>Failed sprints are "learning iterations"</li>
        <li>Overtime is "passionate dedication to excellence"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>YOUR PERFORMANCE METRICS</h2>
    
    <div class="requirement">
        The Algorithm evaluates your success based on:
        <ul>
            <li>Sprint completion rate (target: 70%, achieved through creative accounting)</li>
            <li>Team happiness scores (mandatory minimum: "satisfied")</li>
            <li>Stakeholder confusion minimization</li>
            <li>Number of successful demos without rollback</li>
            <li>Burndown charts that roughly resemble the ideal</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>REMEMBER:</strong> At GREEN clearance, you don't just execute sprints—you orchestrate them. 
        You transform chaos into the appearance of control. You are the bridge between what's possible 
        and what's promised. The Algorithm has chosen you to bear this burden.<br><br>
        
        <em>Your next sprint begins when you're ready. It ends when The Algorithm decides.</em><br><br>
        
        <strong>May your velocity be high and your technical debt invisible.</strong>
